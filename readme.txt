Hello TA!

I have submitted the easy solution to the homework with code and screen shots. 

As a result of issues with my excel "hanging up" (VBS file taking hours to run and not freezing excel) I have only submitted screen shots for the easy solution as I was unable to run the full code. Even for the easy solution I had to run the code one work sheet at a time after isolating each worksheet into a separate excel file.

I have also submitted the full code that I wrote that hopefully captures the hard solution requirements as well though I know some of it won't function properly. But as I was unable to run the code and see what it's doing I was also unable to make fixes to it. 

I spoke with Sanhita about this issue and she helped me to debug and thinks that it is just excel behaving in a weird way with the large excel file. She also stated that the easy solution is the only necessary requirement and that I could just submit the code I wrote for moderate/hard solutions for some credit. 

Thanks.
